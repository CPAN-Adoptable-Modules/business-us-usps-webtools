Business::US::USPS::WebTools::ZipCodeLookup - lookup a Zip Code using the USPS Web Tools

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Business::US::USPS::WebTools::ZipCodeLookup;

	my $looker_upper = Business::US::USPS::WebTools::ZipCodeLookup->new( {
		UserID   => $ENV{USPS_WEBTOOLS_USERID},
		Password => $ENV{USPS_WEBTOOLS_PASSWORD},
		Testing  => 1,
		} );

	my $hash = $looker_upper->lookup_zipcode(
		);

	if( $looker_upper->is_error )
		{
		warn "Oh No! $looker_upper->{error}{description}\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

*** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE ***

This module implements the Zip Code Lookup web service from the
US Postal Service. It is a subclass of Business::US::USPS::WebTools.

sub _fields   { qw( FirmName Address1 Address2 City State) }
sub _required { qw( Address2 City State ) }

=item lookup_zipcode( KEY, VALUE, ... )

The C<lookup_zipcode> method takes the following keys, which come
directly from the USPS web service interface:

	Address2	The street address
	City		The name of the city
	State		The two letter state abbreviation
	Zip5		The 5 digit zip code
	Zip4		The 4 digit extension to the zip code

It returns an anonymous hash with the same keys, but the values are
the USPS's canonicalized address. If there is an error, the hash
values will be the empty string, and the error flag is set. Check is
with C<is_error>:

	$verifier->is_error;

See the C<is_error> documentation in Business::US::USPS::WebTools for more
details on error information.
