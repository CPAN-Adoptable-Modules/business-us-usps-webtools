=head1 NAME

Business::US::USPS::WebTools - Use the US Postal Service Web Tools

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Business::US::USPS::WebTools;
	
	# see subclasses for API details

=head1 DESCRIPTION

*** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE ***

This is the base class for the WebTools web service from the US Postal
Service. The USPS offers several services, and this module handles the
parts common to all of them: making the request, getting the response,
parsing error reponses, and so on. The interesting stuff happens in
one of the subclasses which implement a particular service. So far,
the only subclass in this distribution is 
C<Business::US::USPS::WebTools::AddressStandardization>.

my $LiveServer = "production.shippingapis.com";
my $TestServer = "testing.shippingapis.com";

=item new( ANONYMOUS_HASH )

Make the web service object. Pass is an anonymous hash with these keys:

	UserID		the user id provided by the USPS
	Password	the password provided by the USPS
	Testing		true or false, to select the right server
	
If you don't pass the UserID or Password entries, C<new> looks in the
environment variables USPS_WEBTOOLS_USERID and USPS_WEBTOOLS_PASSWORD.

If C<new> cannot find both the User ID and the Password, it croaks.

If you pass a true value with the Testing key, the object will use the
testing server host name and the testing URL path. If the Testing key
is false or not present, the object uses the live server details.

=item userid

Returns the User ID for the web service. You need to get this from the 
US Postal Service.

=item password

Returns the Password for the web service. You need to get this from the 
US Postal Service.

=item url

Returns the URL for the request to the web service. So far, all requests
are GET request with all of the data in the query string.

=item response

Returns the response from the web service. This is the slightly modified
response. So far it only fixes up line endings and normalizes some error
output for inconsistent responses from different physical servers.

=item is_error

Returns true if the response to the last request was an error, and false
otherwise.

If the response was an error, this method sets various fields in the
object:

	$self->{error}{number}      
	$self->{error}{source}      
	$self->{error}{description} 
	$self->{error}{help_file}   
	$self->{error}{help_context}

	# same way. Some have SOL and some have SoL
